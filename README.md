Practical guide to encrypting the Internet

I have already explained this in summary at http://www.1000names.co.nz
The encryption basically uses an ltwypsyn algorithm to create an encryption
stored on the internet, the decryption process creates the original html
code that was encrypted, loads to an html file located on the users drive
and then opens the page using a hyperlink.
The Beta version has been written using VBA in an Excel spreadsheet,
an example of an encryption is https://sites.google.com/site/ltwpsyn/ltwpsynencryption
The ltwpsyn Reader is available upon request, it currently has 10 encrypted 
internet sites, request here http://www.1000names.co.nz/Contact.html
